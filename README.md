Some math notes and papers I'm working on.


These will mostly be files in .tex format.  Authorship is as listed in each file. Contributions, however, are welcome!  
Significant contributions can result in secondary authorship.
Most of the work here is in using new and noncommutative techniques to solve well known problems.
